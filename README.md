###ractical Exercise 01 - Creating Our First Workflow###
Exercise Description
In this practical exercise, our goal is to create our first workflow.

Here are the instructions for the exercise:

Create a file named 01-building-blocks.yaml under the .github/workflows folder in the root of your repository.

Name the workflow 01 - Building Blocks.

Add the following triggers to your workflow:

push

workflow_dispatch

Add two jobs to the workflow:

The first job, echo-hello, should run on ubuntu-latest and have a single step, named Say hello, which simply prints the "Hello, World!" message on the screen.

The second job, echo-goodbye, should also run on ubuntu-latest and have two steps:

The first step, named Failed step, should run a multi-line bash script which prints "I will fail" on the screen and exits with any non-zero code.

The second step, named Say goodbye, should simply print "Goodbye!" on the screen.

Take some time to play around and inspect what happens once a step fails during the workflow execution.

As a last step, change the first step of the second job to exit with a zero code. You can also adjust the name of the step and the printed message to match the new state.

Have a look at how this impacts the workflow execution.

Change the workflow triggers to contain only workflow_dispatch to prevent this workflow from running with every push and pollute the list of workflow runs.

###Practical Exercise 02 - Using Different Events to Trigger Workflows###
Exercise Description
In this practical exercise, our goal is to explore the different ways we can trigger workflows in GitHub Actions.

Here are the instructions for the exercise:

Create a file named 02-workflow-events.yaml under the .github/workflows folder in the root of your repository.

Name the workflow 02 - Workflow Events.

Add the following triggers to your workflow:

push

Add a single job to the workflow:

The job, named echo, should run on ubuntu-latest and contain a single step, named Show the trigger, which prints the type of the name of the event that triggered the workflow.

Commit the changes and push the code. Take some time to inspect the output of the workflow run.

Now add more triggers to the workflow:

pull_request

schedule (cron expression)

workflow_dispatch

Commit the changes and push the code. Take some time to inspect the different ways the workflow is triggered.

You can create a pull request on GitHub to see how this changes the output of the workflow run.

Also give it a try to trigger it from the UI. To do so:

Click under the "Actions" tab in the home page of the repository.

Select the workflow named 02 - Workflow Events on the left of the screen.

Click on the "Run workflow" button on the right side of the screen, next to the message "This workflow has a workflow_dispatch event trigger."

After exploring the different ways to trigger a workflow, reduce the list of triggers to leave only workflow_dispatch to prevent this workflow from running with every push and pollute the list of workflow runs.
